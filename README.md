### Summary
- It is a very interesting and effective way to practice adding and using these elements in my own bio in the Github. It is definitely a lot more work than just simply inserted some random things as I did not copy and pasted the bio that I had before. Instead, I really tried to make it pretty and attractive by actually thinking about what content I am going to put and how to coordinate the content with the assignment requirement. 
- I am suprised by that we can actually insert images and even use emojis in the Github. I thought it was a boring software before, and these findings definitely motivate me more to learn. Thank you!
